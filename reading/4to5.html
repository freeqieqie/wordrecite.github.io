        <p>
            One sunny <u>Monday</u> morning, Pip is hopping.<br>
            He hops near the pretty <u>river</u>.<br>
            What is that? Pip sees something new.<br>
            It is shiny and silver. It is a small <u>robot</u>!<br>
            The <u>robot</u> turns its head. It waves a little metal hand at Pip.<br>
            "Hello there!" says the <u>robot</u>. Its voice sounds <u>funny</u>, like <i>beep boop</i>.<br>
            Pip stops hopping. He wiggles his nose.<br>
            "I am Bolt," says the <u>robot</u>. "I am designed to be <u>helpful</u>."<br>
            Bolt stands very still. He seems very <u>polite</u>.<br>
            Pip has never seen a <u>robot</u> before. This is exciting!<br>
            He looks at Bolt. Bolt looks very <u>clever</u>.<br>
            Pip smiles at <u>him</u>. Maybe they can be friends.<br>
            Bolt's eyes light up, blinking blue.<br>
            He doesn't look scary at all.

            "<u>Will</u> you truly be my friend?" asks Pip, feeling happy.<br>
            "Yes! Affirmative!" beeps Bolt with a whirring sound.<br>
            Pip’s long ears stand up straight.<br>
            "My dear grandma and <u>grandparent</u> grandpa <u>live</u> far away," Pip explains.<br>
            "I really <u>want</u> to visit them this <u>weekend</u>," Pip says.<br>
            "Maybe we can go on <u>Saturday</u>? Or maybe <u>Sunday</u>?"<br>
            Bolt’s lights blink faster. "Visiting family is a good mission."<br>
            "We can go together! I can be very <u>helpful</u> on the trip," says Bolt.<br>
            "I <u>know</u> the map. I can help us get <u>there</u>."<br>

            A <u>schedule</u> helps them know what to do. Bolt shows a list on his screen.<br>
            Pip hops around, gathering things. He needs to pack some <u>food</u>.<br>
            He makes a tasty carrot <u>sandwich</u>. Carrots are <u>healthy</u>!<br>
            He finds his favorite blue <u>water bottle</u> and fills it with <u>fresh</u> water.<br>
            Bolt says, "Good job, Pip. Water is very <u>healthy</u> to <u>drink</u>."<br>
            Pip looks at his fur. It is a little <u>dirty</u> from playing.<br>
            "Oh!" Pip says. "I think I need to <u>wash my clothes</u>!"<br>
            He washes his little blue vest in the river until it is clean.<br>

        <h2>Chapter 7: Fun and <u>Food</u></h2>
        <p>
            <u>Thursday</u> arrives! Almost time for the trip!<br>
            They practice packing their small travel bag.<br>
            Pip carefully puts in a small <u>photo</u>. It's a <u>photo</u> of his red toy <u>bike</u>.<br>
            Bolt gently packs a tiny green <u>plant</u> in a little pot. Plants like trips too!<br>
            For lunch, they have a pretend picnic under a big, shady <u>tree</u>.<br>
            Pip closes his eyes and imagines a big, juicy <u>hamburger</u>. Mmm, <u>delicious</u>!<br>
            He pretends it is nice and <u>hot</u>, just off the grill.<br>
            Bolt pretends to <u>drink</u> cool, <u>fresh</u> water from his hand-cup. Beep!<br>
            Pip’s real <u>favorite</u> <u>food</u> is carrots, crunchy and orange.<br>
            But sometimes he dreams of yummy <u>ice cream</u>. Strawberry <u>ice cream</u> is so <u>sweet</u>!<br>
            Grandma sometimes makes carrot cake, that is <u>delicious</u> too!<br>
            She never puts <u>onion</u> in it, Pip doesn't <u>like</u> <u>onion</u>.<br>
            Thinking about Grandma's <u>cooking</u> makes Pip happy.<br>
            They also pretend to have <u>salad</u> and drink warm <u>tea</u>.

        <h2>Chapter 8: The Journey Begins</h2>
        <p>
            Yay! <u>Friday</u> morning is here! The sun is shining brightly.<br>
            Time for Pip and Bolt’s big adventure to begin!<br>
            They say goodbye to Pip's little burrow.<br>
            They walk past a tall stone <u>building</u>. Maybe someone used to <u>live</u> there.<br>
            They carefully walk over a little wooden <u>bridge</u>. The stream flows underneath.<br>
            Look way up! They can see a very <u>high</u>, blue <u>mountain</u> far away.<br>
            The <u>mountain</u> looks sleepy in the morning sun.<br>
            Trees, flowers, and birds are all around. This is beautiful <u>nature</u>.<br>
            Bolt carefully carries the blue <u>water bottle</u> for Pip.<br>
            Pip hops happily <u>in front of</u> Bolt. His tail wiggles with excitement.<br>
            "Are we almost <u>there</u> yet, Bolt?" Pip asks.<br>
            "Not yet, Pip," Bolt replies kindly. "But we are moving!"<br>
            The path goes through the pretty green <u>forest</u>.<br>
            They see other little animals watching them.<br>
            The journey is starting well.

        <h2>Chapter 9: River Fun</h2>
        <p>
            They walk and walk, following the winding path.<br>
            Soon, they reach the wide, slow <u>river</u> again. It looks different here.<br>
            "Oh look, Bolt! A little boat! Let's <u>go boating</u>!" says Pip excitedly.<br>
            A small, sturdy boat is tied near the bank. It looks safe.<br>
            They climb in very carefully. Pip sits near the <u>front</u>.<br>
            Bolt sits <u>behind</u> Pip. He uses his robot arms to row gently.<br>
            The boat glides smoothly on the water. Swish, swoosh.<br>
            Splash! A little silver fish jumps right out of the water! Wow!<br>
            "Did you see that?" asks Pip, eyes wide.<br>
            The fish <u>aren't</u> big or scary. They are just playful.<br>
            Look over there! <u>Beside</u> the river bank, a tiny grey <u>mouse</u> scurries past.<br>
            The <u>mouse</u> runs under a big green leaf. It looks busy.<br>
            Being on the <u>river</u> is peaceful and fun.<br>
            Bolt rows steadily. He is a good boat captain.

    <div class="chapter">
        <h2>Chapter 10: Rest and Play</h2>
        <p>
            After the nice boat ride, Pip feels a little <u>tired</u>. Hopping and boating takes energy!<br>
            They find a perfect resting spot under a huge, leafy <u>tree</u>.<br>
            The shade feels cool and nice. "We <u>should</u> rest now," suggests Bolt wisely.<br>
            They sit together on the soft, green grass. What should they <u>do</u>?<br>
            They cannot <u>play football</u> here. They don't have a ball.<br>
            They cannot <u>play basketball</u> either. There is no hoop.<br>
            Playing <u>sport</u> is fun, but resting is good too. They like to <u>play sports</u> sometimes.<br>
            Bolt finds two flat leaves and a tiny, round pebble. "Let's <u>play ping pong</u>!" he beeps.<br>
            They tap the pebble back and forth with the leaves. Tap, tap! Giggle, giggle!<br>
            After their game, Pip wants to <u>read books</u>.<br>
            Bolt projects simple stories with bright pictures onto a large, smooth rock.<br>
            He tells stories about friendly bears and <u>clever</u> foxes.<br>
            They don't <u>watch TV</u> or <u>do homework</u> here in the forest.<br>
            They just enjoy the quiet time together. Bolt is good company.

        <h2>Chapter 11: Almost <u>There</u>!</h2>
        <p>
            After their rest, Pip feels much better. Time to <u>move</u> again!<br>
            They start walking up the last gentle green <u>hill</u>. Up, up, up they go.<br>
            From the very top, Pip gasps! He can see the whole <u>village</u> below!<br>
            "Look, Bolt! Look! I see it! I see my <u>grandparent</u>'s <u>house</u>!" Pip shouts with joy.<br>
            The little yellow <u>house</u> looks warm and welcoming down there.<br>
            It is nestled right <u>between</u> a giant, <u>old</u> oak <u>tree</u> and the baker's shop.<br>
            Pip can even see the little wooden <u>clock</u> hanging <u>above</u> the bright red front door.<br>
            Pip feels so excited he can’t wait another second! He starts to run fast down the path.<br>
            "Come on, Bolt! Hurry! We are almost <u>there</u>! We will <u>finish</u> our adventure soon!"<br>
            Bolt whirs his wheels happily and rolls quickly down the <u>hill</u> after his excited friend.<br>
            Grandma and Grandpa's <u>house</u> is getting closer and closer!<br>
            Pip’s heart beats fast with happiness.

            Grandpa Rabbit smiles his biggest smile. "And who is your shiny friend?" he asks kindly.<br>
            "This is Bolt! My new friend! He's a <u>robot</u> and he's very <u>helpful</u>!" explains Pip proudly.<br>
            They all go inside the cozy, warm <u>house</u>. It smells wonderful!<br>
            Grandma Rabbit is <u>cooking</u> something yummy. It smells <u>delicious</u>!<br>
            Maybe it's her famous carrot soup! She knows Pip doesn't like <u>any</u> <u>onion</u>.<br>
            Grandpa gives them tiny cups of warm berry <u>tea</u>. The <u>tea</u> is not too <u>hot</u>, just right.<br>

            "Maybe we can have a little <u>party</u> next time!" suggests Grandpa. "We can <u>sing</u> a happy <u>song</u>! Or maybe even <u>dance</u>!"<br>
            Bolt cannot <u>play the piano</u>. Bolt cannot do <u>kung fu</u>. Pip cannot <u>swim</u> in the house! But they can all <u>play</u> games together! Bolt can <u>draw</u> pictures for everyone.<br>
